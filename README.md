# K-R-Exercises
Contains solutions for the exercises contained in "The C Programming Language"

Each chapter is contained in a separate directory. Each exercise should be in a
separate file and use the following naming convention:

  |Chapter|-|Exercise|-|Name|.c

Where |Chapter| is the chapter in the book, |Exercise| is the number given in
the book (i.e. 'Exercise 2-7' is exercise 7 of chapter 2.), and exercise name
is either the main function name or something else applicable.
